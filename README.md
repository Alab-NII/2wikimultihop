# 2WikiMultihopQA: A Dataset for Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning Steps

This is the repository for the paper: [Constructing A Multi-hop QA Dataset for Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning Steps](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.coling-main.580/) (COLING 2020).



### New Update (April 7, 2021)
- We release the [para_with_hyperlink.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wlhw26kik59wbh8/para_with_hyperlink.zip) file that contains all articles/paragraphs with hyperlink information (except for some error paragraphs). Each paragraph has the following information:
  * ```id```: Wikipedia id of an article
  * ```title```
  * ```sentences```: a list of sentence
  * ```mentions```: a list of hyperlink information, each element has the following information: ```id```, ```start```, ```end```, ```ref_url```, ```ref_ids```, ```sent_idx```. 
- [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ms2m13252h6xubs/data_ids_april7.zip) is the link of the dataset that has fixed the inconsistency of sentence segmentation in paragraphs. 
 

### Update on December 8, 2020
- Due to the multiple names of an entity in Wikidata, we add ```evidences_id``` and ```answer_id``` to our dataset. Here are the details:
  * For Inference and Compositional questions: we add to all questions.
  * For Comparison and Bridge_comparison questions: we add to questions that have relations: ```country```, ```country of origin```, and ```country of citizenship```.
- We update the new evaluation script [2wikimultihop_evaluation_v1.1.py](https://github.com/Alab-NII/2wikimultihop/blob/main/2wikimultihop_evaluate_v1.1.py). We can use this evaluation script to evaluate the dataset with ```evidences_id``` and ```answer_id```.
- We also update the results of the baseline model by using the new evaluation script and the dataset with ```evidences_id``` and ```answer_id```. The updated results of tables 5, 6, and 7 in the paper are in the folder [update_results](https://github.com/Alab-NII/2wikimultihop/tree/main/update_results).
- [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ep3h8unu2njfxv/data_ids.zip?dl=0) is the link of the dataset with ```evidences_id``` and ```answer_id```.  File ```id_aliases.json``` is used for evaluation.

### Submission guide

To evaluate your model on the test data, please contact us.
Please prepare the following information: 


1. Your prediction file (follow format in file: [prediction_format.json](https://github.com/Alab-NII/2wikimultihop/blob/main/prediction_format.json))
2. The name of your model
3. Public repository of your model (optional)
4. Reference to your publication (optional)



### Dataset Contents
The full dataset is in [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/npidmtadreo6df2/data.zip).

Our dataset follows the format of HotpotQA.
Each sample has the following keys:
- ```_id```: a unique id for each sample
- ```question```: a string
- ```answer```: an answer to the question. The test data does not have this information.
- ```supporting_facts```: a list, each element is a list that contains: ```[title, sent_id]```, ```title``` is the title of the paragraph, ```sent_id``` is the sentence index (start from 0) of the sentence that the model uses. The test data does not have this information.
- ```context```: a list, each element is a list that contains ```[title, setences]```, ```sentences``` is a list of sentences.
- ```evidences```: a list, each element is a triple that contains ```[subject entity, relation, object entity]```. The test data does not have this information.
- ```type```: a string, there are four types of questions in our dataset: comparison, inference, compositional, and bridge-comparison.
- ```entity_ids```: a string that contains the two Wikidata ids (four for bridge_comparison question) of the gold paragraphs, e.g., 'Q7320430_Q51759'.





### Baseline model 
Our baseline model is based on the baseline model in HotpotQA. The process to train and test is quite similar to HotpotQA.

- Process train data
```
python3 main.py --mode prepro --data_file wikimultihop/train.json --para_limit 2250 --data_split train

```

- Process dev data
```
python3 main.py --mode prepro --data_file wikimultihop/dev.json --para_limit 2250 --data_split dev

```

- Train a model
```
python3 -u main.py --mode train --para_limit 2250 --batch_size 24 --init_lr 0.1 --keep_prob 1.0
```

- Evaluation on dev (Local Evaluation)

```
python3 main.py --mode test --data_split dev --para_limit 2250 --batch_size 24 --init_lr 0.1 --keep_prob 1.0 --save WikiMultiHop-20201024-023745 --prediction_file predictions/wikimultihop_dev_pred.json

```

```
python3 2wikimultihop_evaluate.py predictions/wikimultihop_dev_pred.json data/dev.json
```

- Use new evaluation script

```
python3 2wikimultihop_evaluate_v1.1.py predictions/wikimultihop_dev_pred.json data_ids/dev.json id_aliases.json
```
